This was our introduction to Python this semester, and my first experience with the program!
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(reticulate)
```
The Type function will classify an object for you.
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
# An integer
age_in_years = 30
type(age_in_years)
```
