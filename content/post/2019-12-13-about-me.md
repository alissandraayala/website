I am an ecologist in training with a bachelors of science and arts in Biology from the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests are conservation biology, biodiversity, and climate change. I will be pursuing a more advanced degree in graduate school very soon. In the meantime, you can find me in Dr. Melissa Kemp's paleobiology lab where I work on a salamander project. Right now, I am photographing the dentaries, femurs, humeruses, and radiuses of several different species!
My research experience began my freshman year as a student in the Freshman Research Initiative in the Biofuels stream where I studied switchgrass. For my junior and senior years, I have worked under Dr. Kemp on several projects. In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to participate in an REU at Harvard, where I worked at the Arnold Arboretum studying the effects of climate change on the growth and phenology of temperate forests. This REU was one of my first field research experiences. I have also taken 2 field courses at the University of Texas at Austin: Biology of Birds and Plant Systematics.
